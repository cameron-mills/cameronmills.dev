# Welcome to cameronmills.dev

Hi there! I'm Cameron Mills, and welcome to my professional blog. This space is where I'll be sharing insights, experiences, and thoughts on the ever-evolving world of DevSecOps, security engineering, and technical leadership.

## What You Can Expect

### DevSecOps in Practice
I'll share real-world experiences implementing security into development workflows, from CI/CD pipeline security to container orchestration and cloud-native security patterns.

### Technical Deep Dives
Expect detailed posts about security tools, automation strategies, and architectural decisions that have worked (and sometimes haven't worked) in production environments.

### Leadership Insights
Having led security initiatives across various organizations, I'll discuss the challenges and successes of building security culture, managing technical teams, and communicating security needs to stakeholders.

### Industry Perspectives
Commentary on industry trends, new security technologies, and the evolving landscape of DevOps and security convergence.

## Why This Blog?

The intersection of development, operations, and security is where I've spent most of my career, and it's a space that's constantly evolving. My goal is to contribute to the community discussion around making security an enabler rather than a roadblock in software delivery.

Whether you're a developer looking to integrate more security into your workflow, an operations engineer dealing with security requirements, or a security professional trying to keep up with modern development practices, I hope you'll find something valuable here.

## Let's Connect

I believe the best insights come from community discussions. Feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:cameron@cameronmills.dev) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/cameronmills) if you have thoughts on any of the topics I discuss, questions about DevSecOps implementations, or just want to chat about the industry.

Here's to building more secure software, together!
